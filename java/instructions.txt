This is some java programs that utilize the echo sketch. 

You will need to load the echo.ino program to your arduino first.  Then you will need to change 
the serial port listed in each one of the java programs to match whatever serial port
your arduino is plugged into.

jssc_echo.java - very basic program.  The echo sketch sends the string
"arduino ready".  This program captures that input and prints it out on the screen.

jssc_portlistjava - this simple program prints out on the screen all the 
available serial ports

jssc_fancyecho.java - a gui program that gives the user a text box to enter in some text
and a button to send the string to the arduino.  It also has a label that displays
the data that comes back from the arduino
